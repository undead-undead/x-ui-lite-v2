# Changelog

All notable changes to X-UI-Lite will be documented in this file.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-01-11

### 🚀 Bug Fixes & Optimization

- **Dual-Stack Traffic Statistics**: Added support for `ip6tables` to ensure IPv6 traffic is correctly counted in the node list.
- **Accurate System Status Speed**: Optimized system network interface monitoring by excluding loopback and virtual interfaces, providing more accurate real-world traffic speeds.
- **Priority Rules**: Ensured traffic counting rules are always at the top of the `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` chains to prevent bypass by established connection rules or firewall overrides.
- **Robust Rule Check**: Improved the rule synchronization logic for higher reliability.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-01-11

### 🚀 Major Improvements

- **100% Accurate Traffic Statistics**: Re-implemented the traffic counting algorithm using Linux Kernel `iptables` counters. This bypasses the limitations of log parsing and provides bit-perfect traffic tracking directly from the network layer.
- **Atomic Database Updates**: Traffic usage is now updated using atomic SQL operations, preventing race conditions and ensuring data integrity.
- **Automatic Quota Enforcement**: The new traffic manager automatically disables inbound nodes that exceed their traffic quota in real-time.

### ✨ New Features & UI Enhancements

- **Simplified UI**: Cleaned up the XHTTP mode display text for a more professional look.
- **Automated Firewall Management**: The traffic manager automatically handles `iptables` rule creation and synchronization for all inbound nodes.
- **Robust Persistence**: Traffic counters now survive system reboots and service restarts gracefully.

### 🧹 Codebase Cleanup

- **Removed Redundant Scripts**: Deleted legacy installation and deployment scripts, consolidating logic into the main `install.sh`.
- **Project Structure Optimization**: Cleaned up temporary build files and updated `.gitignore` for a cleaner repository.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-11

### 🚀 Major Changes

**Switched from Xray-Core to xray-lite**

This is a complete rewrite of the core proxy engine, replacing the official Go-based Xray-Core with pure Rust xray-lite implementation.

### ✨ New Features

- **Pure Rust Core**: xray-lite is written entirely in Rust, providing better performance and lower memory usage
- **Ultra-Low Memory**: Total system footprint reduced to ~60MB (Backend 50MB + xray-lite 10MB)
- **Zero GC Overhead**: No Go runtime, no garbage collection pauses
- **Built-in Anti-Probing**: Strict SNI validation prevents active server detection
- **Raw VLESS over H2**: Minimum latency with raw pipe transport

### 🔧 Technical Changes

- **Configuration Simplified**: Removed API, Stats, and Policy configurations (not needed for xray-lite)
- **Traffic Statistics Disabled**: xray-lite doesn't provide gRPC API for statistics
- **Version Detection**: Updated to support both `--version` and `-version` flags
- **Download Source**: Changed from XTLS/Xray-core to undead-undead/xray-lite

### 📝 Configuration Format

xray-lite uses a simplified configuration format:
- No `api` section
- No `stats` section
- No `policy` section
- Only core inbound/outbound/routing configuration

### 🔄 Migration Notes

When upgrading from v1.x to v2.x:

1. Your existing inbound configurations will be automatically converted
2. Traffic statistics will no longer update (limitation of xray-lite)
3. All other panel features remain the same

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- Traffic quota enforcement still works but traffic counters won't increase (API limitation)
- If you need traffic statistics, please continue using v1.x with Xray-Core

### 🙏 Credits

- [Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core) - Original Reality protocol design
